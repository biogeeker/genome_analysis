Here, I would record some tools for genome assembly, annotation, and comparative genomics analysis when I used during my projects. Also, some useful scripts would be included in this part.

## Genome assembly
- ### Short read sequencing


- ### Long read sequencing

## Genome annotation


## Comparative analysis
