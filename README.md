# Genome analysis tools

Here, I would record some tools for genome assembly, annotation, and comparative genomics analysis when I used during my projects. Also, some useful scripts would be included in this part.

### Genome assembly
#### Next Generation Sequencing


#### Single-Molecule Real Time Sequencing

### Genome annotation


### Comparative analysis
