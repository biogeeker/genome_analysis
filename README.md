# Genome analysis tools

Here, I would record some tools for genome assembly, annotation, and comparative genomics analysis when I used during my projects. Also, some useful scripts would be included in this part.

## Genome assembly
### Short read sequencing
- Trinity (K-mer â‰¤ 32)
```
# Trinity default k-mer 25, maximum 32
$ Trinity --seqType fq --left reads_1.fq --right reads_2.fq --CPU 6 --max_memory 20G 
```
- SPAdes (Metagenome)
- SOAPdenovo (BGI)
- Velvet (?)

### Long read sequencing

## Genome annotation


## Comparative analysis
